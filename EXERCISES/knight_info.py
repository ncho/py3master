# right now the script is stopping when it raises an error
# so input like "arthur bob lancelot" is not outputting lancelot's info
# need to figure this out

# the exception is unhandled so execution is stopping

# I need conditional statements that check if the name is in the list

# if the name is not in the list, the class has no defined properties

# eventually I got this to work like how I wanted, meaning the output is correct
# but I feel like this can be betterâ€¦ I feel like there's too much happening in this script
# and more should be happening in the knight.py module
